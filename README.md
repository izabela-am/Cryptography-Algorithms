# Cryptography Algorithms
Implementation of various cryptography algorithms, written in C and C++

## :warning: First things first
__You'll need a C/C++ compiler to run these programs.__  
I recommend you use [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html)

## :computer: How to run the program:
```shell
  # Clone this repository
  git clone https://github.com/izabela-am/Cryptography-Algorithms.git
  
  # Go to the project directory
  cd Cryptography-Algorithms
  
  # Acess directory of the algorithm you want to use, ex:
  cd CaesarCipher
  
  # Run the program
  gcc src/main.c -o main
```
